# Brandon's Bowling Balls
Recently, I have gotten really into bowling. Here I list ally my current bowling balls I own. My current high score is a 252.

## Idol Cosmos - Symmetric Core
- Manufacturer: Storm
- Weight: 15lbs
- RG: 2.49
- Differential: 0.052
- Coverstock: Pearl Reactive
I like this ball in heavier oil conditions because it has a rounder hook and the stronger coverstock allows for it to bite into the lane earlier.

## Phaze V - Symmetric Core
- Manufacturer: Storm
- Weight: 15lbs
- RG: 2.48
- Differential: 0.051
- Coverstock: Pearl Reactive
I like this ball for later in the game as the weaker coverstock allows it to get down lane easier before the breakpoint and it has a sharp hook into the pocket.
