# Brandon Imai's User Page
**Welcome _everyone!_** This is my user page for **CSE 110** for the _Spring 2023_ quarter. I am ~~excited~~ ~~pumped~~ stoked to get going!
## A Little About Me
My name is **Brandon Imai** and I am a second-year computer science major at ERC. I enjoy sports and am a big fan of the Los Angeles Angels, Anaheim Ducks, and Los Angeles Clippers. I also enjoy auto racing and watch Formula 1, Formula E, and Indycar. I am a big fan of Star Wars and try as much as I can to live by Yoda's wisdom:
> Do or do not, there is not try.

Outside of school I am active in [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.ucsd.edu/) (HKN) and play for the [UCSD Club Baseball Team](https://recreation.ucsd.edu/competitive-sports/baseball/) where I serve as the Treasurer. I also recently got really into [bowling](./bowling.md).
